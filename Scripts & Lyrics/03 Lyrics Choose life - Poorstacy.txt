Don't live life limited to the boundaries
That you've created for yourself
Choose to do as you please
Don't give up
Choose life
Why should I try?
If I'm gonna lose you anyway
I don't wanna see another day
Oh I say
Why should I try?
If I'm gonna lose you anyway
I don't wanna see another day
Oh, oh, oh
Bad days and bad relations
Now all I do is pace around my room all day
(My room all day)
Everything's so complicated
When all you do is think about what people have to say
(What people have to say)
I'm always wrong, you're always right
Why do we always have to fight?
All that I do is sacrifice myself for you
I've been looking for the light
I think I'm running out of time
I wanna dance the night away with you
Why should I try?
If I'm gonna lose you anyway
I don't wanna see another day
Oh I say
Why should I try?
If I'm gonna lose you anyway
I don't wanna see another day
Oh, oh, oh
Why should I try?
Why should I try?
Why should I try?
Why should I try?
Why should I try?
If I'm gonna lose you anyway
I don't wanna see another day
Oh I say
Why should I try?
If I'm gonna lose you anyway
I don't wanna see another day
Oh, oh, oh
