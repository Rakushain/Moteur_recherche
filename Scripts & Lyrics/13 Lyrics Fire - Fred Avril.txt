Power, hit as hard as you can
We can't be lovers, that's why it's got to end
A monster, is that what I am?
Oh! My anger, we meet everywhere

Fire!!

Fire, bounces inside your eyes
Are you the last man, who will be in my arms?
Fire, is inside your heart
Am I the last who will die in your arms?
Fire

Hell of a feast
Come closer
Hell of a feast
Come closer
Hell of a feast
Come closer
Hell of feast
Come closer

Fire!!

Hell of a feast
Come closer now!
Hell of a feast
Come closer now!
Hell of a feast
Come closer now!
Hell of a feast
Closer now...
