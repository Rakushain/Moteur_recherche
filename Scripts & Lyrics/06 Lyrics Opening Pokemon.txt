I wanna be the very best
That no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my 'cause
I will travel across that land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokemon to understand
The power that's inside
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all, it's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all, a heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you, Pokemon
You gotta catch 'em all
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
Pikachu
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all, it's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Pokemon, oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all, a heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me and I'll teach you, Pokemon
You gotta catch 'em all
Pokemon, gotta catch 'em all
