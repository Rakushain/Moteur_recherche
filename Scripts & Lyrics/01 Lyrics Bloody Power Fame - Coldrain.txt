Save the pain for another day
Say you understand, swear to look away
Don't you dare go asking any questions (any questions)
What you feel, isn't real
Dry your tears, learn to pretend
Never take a stand, bow and comprehend
Don't you dare go asking any questions (any questions)
The less you think, the more you win
The less you give, the more you get
(Bloody, power, fame)
(Bloody, power, fame)
It's all out of control, out of control
Nothing will save us anymore
Standing at the gates of hell
Still wanting more, more, more
Bloody, power and fame
Locked out of heaven
Sins unforgiven
'Cause we're only painting over what's been done (what's been done)
Every time we look away
The more and more we die each day
(Bloody, power, fame)
(Bloody, power, fame)
It's all out of control, out of control
Nothing will save us anymore
Standing at the gates of hell
Still wanting more, more, more
Bloody power and fame
All we want is
Bloody power and fame
On the edge, over board
We'll descend ever more
At the end of it all
Will we see what we've become?
On the edge, over board
We'll descend ever more
At the end of it all
Will we see what we've become?
Falling pieces
Spending days just to pick them up
Knowing deep within
We can't go on like this
Out of control, out of control
Nothing will save us anymore
Standing at the gates of hell
Still wanting more, more, more
Bloody, power and fame
All we want is
Bloody power and fame
All we want is
Bloody power and fame
